    "# Demand Estimation Exercise\n",
    "### Part 0 : Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will be doing guided demand estimation for heterogeneous product models. The techniques presented in this assignment are commonly used in research and for policy decisions. In this assignment we will focus on obtaining post-estimation elasticities of demand from two different models. Demand elasticites can only be obtained once we know the parameters defining the demand function. The purpose is that you understand how model misspecification leads to biased elasticities estimates and how such biases might impact policy and theoretical results. For the assignment you will use simulated data for which we exactly know the data generation process. A detailed description is provided below. \n",

    "**(a) Model description**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a market with $N$ consumers, $J$ firms, across $T$ time periods (You can also see the time periods as geographically separated markets. This is an important assumption for heterogeneous product models, consumers can only activate within one market (Berry, 2021)). In this simplified model we assume firms are going to sell just one products, as such firms and product can be used interchangeably. The consumers have heterogeneous preferences over prices. The indirect utility of the consumers is going to be given by: \n",

    "Where: \n",
    "- $x_j$ is a  time invariant product characteristic \n",
    "-  $p_{jt}$ is the price of the product sold by firm $j$ in period $t$ \n",
    "- $\\xi_{jt}$ are product-market specific fixed effects which are correlated with $p_{jt}$\n",
    "- $\\beta$ is the coefficient of the product characteristic and it is constant across consumers \n",
    "- $\\alpha_{it}$ is the consumer specific price coefficient defined as $\\alpha_{it} =  \\mu_{\\alpha} + \\sigma_{\\alpha} \\nu_{it}^{p}$, where $\\nu_{it}^{p}$ are i.i.d. standard normal random variables. \n",
    "-$\\varepsilon_{ijt}$ is the error term following a Type 1 extreme value distribution \n",

    "Following from standard theory (ref slides) we know we can thereafter rewrite indirect utility as: \n",

    "\n",
    "Consumers purchase one unit of the good that gives them the highest utility. Each market has the same number of consumers across time, $N$. By assuming that the error term $\\varepsilon_{ijt}$ follows from the type-I extreme value distribution, the probability $f_{ijt}$ that consumer $i$ buys product $j$ in market $t$ is given by the multinomial logit function: \n",
